# sjrk-dynamic-view-component

## What Is This?

This is a set of grades for extending the "dynamic subcomponents" feature of Infusion (https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/SubcomponentDeclaration.html#dynamic-components) with some specific behaviours around managing the addition and deletion of dynamic view components.

A sample to-do list application is included.
